## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android device with API level 21+ (Android 5.0)
- WiFi capability
- Location permissions

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hashim-K/SPS-Bayesian-Localization
   ```

2. Open in Android Studio

3. Build and install on your Android device

4. Grant required permissions:
   - Location access (Fine location)
   - WiFi state access
   - Nearby devices (Android 12+)

### **Initial Setup**
1. **Data Collection Phase**:
   - Navigate to "WiFi Scan" tab
   - Select a cell (C1-C10) representing your current location
   - Choose "Training" mode
   - Use "Batch Mode" to collect multiple samples automatically
   - Repeat for all locations you want to map

2. **Location Prediction**:
   - Navigate to "Home" tab
   - Click "Guess Location"
   - The app will predict your current cell based on WiFi signals

## üìä **How It Works**

### **WiFi Fingerprinting Process**
1. **Signal Collection**: Scan WiFi networks and record RSSI values
2. **BSSID Aggregation**: Group multiple radios from same device using "BSSID Prime"
3. **Histogram Generation**: Build probability distributions for each AP at each location
4. **Bayesian Inference**: Use Bayes' theorem to predict location from current WiFi scan

### **BSSID Prime Algorithm**
Converts `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` ‚Üí `AABBCCDDEEFX` to aggregate multiple radios (2.4GHz, 5GHz) from the same router.

### **Prediction Modes**
- **Serial Mode**: Process APs sequentially until confidence threshold is reached
- **Parallel Mode**: Process all APs simultaneously and combine probabilities

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Options**

- **Prediction Mode**: Serial vs Parallel processing
- **PMF Bin Width**: Histogram resolution (1-20)
- **Serial Cutoff Probability**: Confidence threshold (0.01-1.0)
